    <h2>Low and Show</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
    <p>This week I am extremely about a new cooking technique
        called sous vide.In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
        (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
        precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
        cooked to. In his book,<em> Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes
        it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
        Hollandaise</strong>. reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
        before November 30.
