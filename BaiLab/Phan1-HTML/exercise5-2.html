        <h1>Low and Show</h1>
        <p>This week I am extremely about a new cooking technique
            called sous vide.In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
            (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
            precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
            cooked to. In his book,<em> Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes
            it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
            Hollandaise.<strong> reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
            before November 30.</strong>

            if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
